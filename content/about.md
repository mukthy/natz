My name is Muktheeswaran, my friends call me Mukthy or Nathan. My alias in cyber security is (natzsec). I am a Security Researcher from TamilNadu - India.

I am currently working with a company which is leading Security Company in IT-Security industry and makes Anti-Viruses and EDR solutions as well. For more information about it you can check my Linkldn.

I love finding vulnerabilites in Applications. Using Penetration Testing I find the vulnerabilites or loopholes to penetrate into Networks or Servers. I also test Web-Apps and Mobile Applications for vulnerabilities. 

Recently I have developed interest in Reverse Engineering and doing Malware Analysis, this also made poke into Iot Devices. I feel Internet-of-things is the future, it is already occupied is most of our lives in different ways which we do not realize but soon it will be everywhere.

Taking things apart and looking inside is what made me poke into Iot, because in Iot we have to open the hardware devices once in a while to see what is inside.

Apart from this I love to play games, I am a big fan of CSGO and Call of Duty. I love photography as well but I don't own a DSLR, I try to capture the best moments using my phone.

I am not good at programming, like someone from core development. But I do understand the logic and do scripting. 

I know Python and learning the Assessmly Language which will help in Reverse Engineering.

I am a CTF player too, you can check my profile in HackTheBox and TryHackMe.
